## About this Game

***Colors*** is a two-or-more player game for all ages.

Colors are engaged in war. The action happens on the color wheel. Who will win the war?

## Commencing the Game

Each player builds a *Deck* of sixty (60) cards using a combination of various *"Color cards"* (the main type of cards used to attack) and *"Action cards"* (cards with special effects). New cards and even kinds of cards are to be released and players may get *"Booster packs"* to integrate these cards into their own decks or *"Tournament packs"* that have all the cards required for play. The *Colors* game uses a standard deck of 60 cards, though the amount can be adjusted for the time of the *Match*, for example, *"Half Decks"* consisting of 30 cards instead. This is the *official* rulebook, however fans are encouraged to create their own game rules and playing methods.

## Setup

A game of *Colors* is called a *"Match"*. Players cast a lot to decide who goes first. Play then continues clockwise.

After determining which player goes first, all players place their *Shuffled deck* face down somewhere on their part of the play area, or *"Field"*. A part of the Field is designated as the *"Color wheel"* where the action takes place. This Color wheel has place for three cards: the two opponents' Color cards in an attack, and an Action card (or a pile of), if any. The players then each take seven cards from the top of their respective decks. These cards go into their *"Hand"*. Next, each player sets aside *"Prize cards"* based on the amount of cards in the deck. These are put from the top of their deck face down.

### 10 Cards = 1 Prize Card

## Turns

Once the setup is finished, the game commences, and goes in turns. A player's turn consists of the following:

1. First, draw a card from the top of that player's deck. This is the *Draw phase*.
2. Play any Action cards in that player's Hand by placing the card on the color wheel's action pile and pertaining to the rules on each Action card. This is the *Deployment phase*.
3. Optionally, at the very end of the turn, *"Attack"* by placing a Color card on the color wheel. Attacking **always ends** that player's turn.
   - However, a player can't put a Color card if they aren't able to attack.
4. End the turn.

Play goes clockwise until the game ceases.

## Deployment

After a player draws a card at the start of a turn, that turn's *Deployment phase* commences.

In that phase, players may play Action cards by placing the card on the color wheel and pertaining to the rules on each Action card.

These are the clarifications for some of the Action cards.

### Action Colors

Cards with the type "Action Color" are attached to a color, and not put on the color wheel's action pile, unlike regular Action cards.

## Attack

Once two players each put one of their colors on the color wheel, an *Attack* begins.

Both colors have an arbitrary damage counter, that determine whoever wins that attack.

Whoever puts their Color card later gets the first strike with a bonus of 1 damage inflicted on the opposing colour.

- However, if the attack order is switched around, whoever put their Color card *earlier* gets the first strike.

Next, the colors beaten according to the rules on the Color card get 1 damage inflicted.

Next, additional calculations are made.

- If a color is at an advantage, its damage counter is divided by two, rounded up.
- If a color is at a disadvantage, its damage counter is multiplied by two.

Lastly, the winner is decided. Whoever color has a larger damage counter loses, is *Expelled* out of the color wheel and placed face up in the player's *Discard Pile* along with any other cards that were attached to it.

At the same time, the player who expelled their opponent's color out gets to take one of that player's remaining face down *Prize cards* and put that prize card into that player's hand.

## Ceasing the Game

The *Match* is ceased when a player wins the match.

To win a match, players must:

- Take all of their prize cards by expelling their opponent's colors by Attacking them.
- If one of their opponents cannot draw a card from their Deck at the beginning of their turn, they lose. They can't play anymore. The last player standing wins.
